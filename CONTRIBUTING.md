## 🐞 Contributing

This project has a lot of room for improvement in optimizing regexps, better OOP, and bug fixes. <br/>
If you make an issue, pr, or suggestion, it'll be very appreciated <3.

I'd prefer if you opened an issue before making a pull request with new features, <br/>
but a bug fix patch can be opened whenever :)
