## 🐞 Contributing

This project has a lot of room for improvement in optimizing regexps, better OOP, bug fixes, and completing todos. <br/>
If you make an issue, pr, or suggestion, it'll be very appreciated <3.

I'd prefer if you opened an issue before making a pull request with new features, <br/>
but if you find a bug and want to fix it, that can be opened whenever :))
